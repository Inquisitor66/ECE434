wired to P8_7, P8_9, P8_11, and P8_15. It should be run with "sudo python

The second executable is EtchASketchButton.py which runs an X by Y Etch a
Sketch. The Move left button is wired to P8_14, the Move Right button is
wired to P9_11, the Move Up button is wired to P8_10, and the Move Down
button is wired to P8_12. It also has a reset screen button wired to P8_16
and a Quit Game button wired to P8_18. It should be run with "sudo
./EtchASketchButton.py xDim yDim" where xDim is how many spaces in the x
