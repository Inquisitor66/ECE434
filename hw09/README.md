The purpose of this assignment was to write values from some input to a cloud based data storage system like Google sheets or ThingSpeak. Both were implemented and the code for which is located in the directory bearing the name of the service. The code to run in both directories is called "temp.js". There is also a setup.sh file to configure the i2c pins, as the data I was reading for this homework was from a TMP101 sensor I had connected to P9_17 and P9_18. The path to my google sheets page is:

 And the path to the ThingSpeak page is:

 Both of these have been shared with you Dr. Yoder

 PS: When doing git maintenance after the presentations I realized I never committed this or shared the pages with you, I'm sorry about that Dr. Yoder
